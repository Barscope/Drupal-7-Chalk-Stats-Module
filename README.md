# Chalk Drupal Stats Module

This module includes all necessary files to use the Chalk Services located at  [http://delivery.chalk247.com](http://delivery.chalk247.com) in Drupal 7.

You will need to have a valid api key to use this module, please contact sales@getchalk.com to obtain one.

Once implemented your stats will follow the path 

/Stats/component/sport/league

For example for the list of upcoming matchups for NFL you would use 

/Stats/Matchups/Football/NFL

For your convenience a navigation component is included using default settings based upon your configuration.  Landing on any valid stats page will load it.
